SOLUTION

You cannot just copy and paste this solution code because
the bucket name needs to be your bucket name.

If you run it "as is" it will not work!

You must replace <FMI> with your bucket name.

E.g.,

2019-03-02-sally-catlostandfoundwebsite

Keep the quotes around the bucket name, and  only
replace the characters <FMI>.
